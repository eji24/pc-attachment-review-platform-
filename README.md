## Project Proposal Summary
The platform aims to provide a centralized hub for PC enthusiasts to share experiences, offer feedback, and assist others in making informed decisions when purchasing PC attachments.

## Phase 1: Initial Design & Setup
### Analysis
- The project was set up with the aim to develop a frontend using React and a backend with NodeJS.
- A user-friendly design was envisioned to provide a smooth user experience.
- Initial challenges included coordinating between team members, ensuring design consistency, and working without a connected backend.

### Implementation
- Created basic components like the landing page, login, and registration forms.
- Incorporated a design with clear navigation options for user interaction.
- Envisioned features like user registration, login, profile management, review submission, and display were planned.

## Phase 2: Development & Challenges
### Analysis
- Focus was on further development of the frontend while backend integration was considered.
- There was a realization that certain goals might not be achieved within the set timeframe due to the complexities involved, especially integrating a MongoDB database.

### Implementation
- Due to difficulties with MongoDB, user registration data and review data storage were moved to the frontend.
- GIT collaboration became challenging due to ever-changing codebases. Alternatives like Microsoft Teams were also explored but found to be inefficient.
- React Router challenges arose because of older versions in package.json. A decision was made to build the on-click landing page on the frontend instead of navigating using routes.

## Final Product Implementation
### Analysis
- Aimed to consolidate the work from the two phases and offer a presentable and functional product.
- While not all initial goals were met, adaptability became a significant asset as the project progressed. The project was modified based on the team's skillset and available time.

### Implementation
- A functional login system was developed, leading users directly to the review section.
- Dummy reviews were set in place to simulate user interactions.
- An old-school, retro style was chosen for the frontend, keeping the design clean and appealing with blue-on-blue tones.
- Navigation was improved, with a home button directing to the review page post-login and a search bar for potential future enhancements.

## Repository Structure
- `/src`: Contains the entire codebase for the project. This is where all the React components, services, and assets are stored.

## Getting Started

To run the PC Attachment Review Platform on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Set up a new React environment: `npx create-react-app my-react-project_phase_2`
2. Replace the 'src' folder in the newly created React environment with the 'src' folder from this repository.
3. Navigate into the project directory: `cd my-react-project_phase_2`
4. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the server: `npm start`
6. Open your web browser and access the application at http://localhost:3000.



## Conclusion

Despite facing several challenges throughout the development process, we managed to adapt and produce a functional product with our available skills and resources. Though we couldn't implement all our initial features, we learned to pivot and adjust our objectives based on the situation. We are proud of the final product we've delivered and believe it serves as a testament to our dedication, adaptability, and collaborative effort. This project presented numerous opportunities for growth, both as developers and collaborators. The knowledge and experience gained from this project will undeniably assist us in future endeavors.
