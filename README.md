## Project Proposal Summary
The PC Attachment Review Platform is a web application that allows users to post and read reviews about various PC attachments such as keyboards, mice, monitors, and more. The purpose of the platform is to provide a centralized hub for PC enthusiasts and users to share their experiences, provide feedback, and help others make informed decisions when purchasing PC attachments.

## Project Requirements
- Design a user-friendly and intuitive web interface using React, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Implement a login system to allow users to create profiles, log in, and manage their reviews.
- Develop a backend using NodeJS to handle user authentication, review storage, and API integration.
- Create a database to store user login information and reviews.

## Functionality
The PC Attachment Review Platform will have the following key features:
- User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing their email and password.
- User Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their credentials.
- Profile Management: Users can view and edit their profiles, update their information, and manage their reviews.
- Review Submission: Users can submit reviews for different PC attachments, including ratings, descriptions, and additional details.
- Review Display: Users can browse and read reviews posted by other users.
- Search and Filter: Users can search for specific PC attachments or apply filters to narrow down their search results.

## Development Plan
1. Week 1: Project setup, environment configuration, and initial React application setup.
2. Week 2-3: Front-end development, including UI design, component creation, and user authentication implementation.
3. Week 4-5: Back-end development using NodeJS, including API creation, database integration, and review storage implementation.
4. Week 6: Integration of front-end and back-end, testing, and bug fixes.
5. Week 7: Finalize the project, documentation, and preparation for submission.
