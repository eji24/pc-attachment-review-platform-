## Project Proposal Summary

The PC Attachment Review Platform is a web application that allows users to post and read reviews about various PC attachments such as keyboards, mice, monitors, and more. The purpose of the platform is to provide a centralized hub for PC enthusiasts and users to share their experiences, provide feedback, and help others make informed decisions when purchasing PC attachments.

## Project Status

While we encountered several obstacles during the development process, we managed to adjust our initial goals and expectations to fit our current skillset and timeframe. Consequently, the final product, while different from our initial vision, still serves its purpose effectively. Currently, user data and reviews are stored on the frontend, providing a solid foundation for future integration with a backend database.

## Challenges Faced

- Implementation of MongoDB database for user registration data and user review data.
- Working collaboratively and synchronizing codebases via GIT repository or Microsoft Teams.
- Creating an on-click landing page with React Router.

## Project Achievements

- Developed a functional login system where users are directed to the review page upon logging in.
- Created a visually pleasing and intuitive user interface with a retro, clean, and concise design.
- Enabled the Home button to redirect users to the review page after login.
- Integrated a search bar on the screen and in the navigation bar.

## Functionality

The PC Attachment Review Platform has the following key features:

- User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing a username and password.
- User Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their credentials.
- Profile Management: Users can view and edit their profiles, update their information, and manage their reviews.
- Review Submission: Users can submit reviews for different PC attachments, including ratings, descriptions, and additional details.
- Review Display: Users can browse and read reviews posted by other users.
- Search and Filter: Users can search for specific PC attachments or apply filters to narrow down their search results.

## Development Plan

- Week 1: Project setup, environment configuration, and initial React application setup.
- Week 2-3: Front-end development, including UI design, component creation, and user authentication implementation.
- Week 4-5: Front-end development of review system, including review submission and display.
- Week 6: Integration and testing, and bug fixes.
- Week 7: Finalize the project, documentation, and preparation for submission.

## Repository Structure

- /src: Contains all the frontend code.

## Getting Started

To run the PC Attachment Review Platform on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Set up a new React environment: `npx create-react-app my-react-project_phase_2`
2. Replace the 'src' folder in the newly created React environment with the 'src' folder from this repository.
3. Navigate into the project directory: `cd my-react-project_phase_2`
4. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the server: `npm start`
6. Open your web browser and access the application at http://localhost:3000.

## Additional Notes

The project has been simplified due to the difficulties faced during development. The current implementation provides a minimal viable product and is open for further enhancement in future.
