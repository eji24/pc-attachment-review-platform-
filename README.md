## Project Proposal Summary
The PC Attachment Review Platform is a web application that allows users to post and read reviews about various PC attachments such as keyboards, mice, monitors, and more. The purpose of the platform is to provide a centralized hub for PC enthusiasts and users to share their experiences, provide feedback, and help others make informed decisions when purchasing PC attachments.

## Project Status
We are in the development phase of the project right now. The frontend has been largely developed while the backend has yet to be implemented. 

## Challenges Faced
- Coordinating while having different schedules
- Ensuring we both have the same style and format
- Choosing the right color scheme
- Maintaining consistency
- Visualising and developing frontend while having no connected backend








## Project Requirements
- Design a user-friendly and intuitive web interface using React, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Implement a login system to allow users to create profiles, log in, and manage their reviews.
- Develop a backend using NodeJS to handle user authentication, review storage, and API integration.
- Create a database to store user login information and reviews.

## Functionality
The PC Attachment Review Platform will have the following key features:
- User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing a username and password.
- User Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their credentials.
- Profile Management: Users can view and edit their profiles, update their information, and manage their reviews.
- Review Submission: Users can submit reviews for different PC attachments, including ratings, descriptions, and additional details.
- Review Display: Users can browse and read reviews posted by other users.
- Search and Filter: Users can search for specific PC attachments or apply filters to narrow down their search results.

## Development Plan
1. Week 1: Project setup, environment configuration, and initial React application setup.
2. Week 2-3: Front-end development, including UI design, component creation, and user authentication implementation.
3. Week 4-5: Back-end development using NodeJS, including API creation, database integration, and review storage implementation.
4. Week 6: Integration of front-end and back-end, testing, and bug fixes.
5. Week 7: Finalize the project, documentation, and preparation for submission.

## Repository Structure
- `/frontend`: Contains the React frontend code.
- `/backend`: Contains the NodeJS backend code.
- `/database`: Contains scripts and configurations related to the database.

5. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Notes
- The project is subject to revision and improvement as we progress through the course and gain more knowledge about React and NodeJS.


## Screenshots
  ### Screenshot 1: Landing Page
  The landing page has a welcoming banner that introduces visitors to "The PC Attachment Review Platform". A brief description under "About Us" highlights the platform's purpose and key features. Navigation options at the bottom include "Home", "Login", "Register", "Profile", "Reviews", and "Search". The page concludes with a footer with copyright info.
  
  ### Screenshot 2:
  These are two screenshots that show both the login and registration forms as well as a sneak peek into the user profile and review functionalities. In the upper area, users are provided with forms to enter their username and password for either logging in or registering a new account. Upon successful login, users can navigate to their profile. In the lower section, a review board displays examples of user reviews, each containing a rating and a comment, along with the name of the user who posted it. Finally, there's a 'Submit Review' form at the bottom, where users can rate a product and provide their own comments about features, etc.
